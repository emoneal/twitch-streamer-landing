                🐰 Hold onto your headsets, fellow digital travelers! I&apos;m PixelEmii, your favorite glitch in the system! Once a corporate code warrior, now a digital bunny thanks to a questionable mixture of energy drinks, sake, and one very cursed keyboard. Oops?            </p>

                ☕ These days, you can find me running Byte &amp; Brew, the coziest digital café this side of the internet! Come for the suspiciously potent coffee, stay for the chaos! (Just don&apos;t ask what&apos;s in the Bunny Blast Energy Latte... some codes are better left uncompiled!)

                🎮 As a variety streamer, I&apos;ll play anything that catches these digital bunny ears! Whether I&apos;m breaking physics engines in simulator games, causing mayhem in MMOs, or sharing stories from my 12 years in Japan, there&apos;s never a dull moment in this rabbit hole!

                ⚡ Warning: May experience occasional buffer overflows of energy and random naptime crashes! Side effects of my streams may include: uncontrollable laughter, sudden cravings for coffee, and a suspicious improvement in your device&apos;s performance...
